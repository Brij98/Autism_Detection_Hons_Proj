# Diagnosing Autism Using Eye-Tracking Data and Ensemble Learning

## Description
This project uses eye-tracking data set collected from https://zenodo.org/record/2647418#.X1YnuXkzZPY to diagnose autism in children around the age of eight using ensemble learning.
The program extracts scanpath and saliency features from the eye-tracking data and the image that was used to collect the eye-tracking data.
From the extracted features an ensemble of machine learning algorithims are trained and tested.
The final classification is conducted based on majority votes from the different trained models.
